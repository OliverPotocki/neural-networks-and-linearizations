JAX based reimplementation of the paper 'When Do Neural Networks Outperform Kernel Methods?'

==============================

<!-- ACKNOWLEDGMENTS -->
## Acknowledgments

The ideas behind this code are based on research done in the paper [B. Ghorbani, S. Mei,T. Misiakiewicz, A. Montanari. When Do Neural Networks Outperform Kernel Methods? *arXiv preprint*, 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.13409).

## Goal

The goal is to investigate and compare the performance of neural networks and kernel ridge regression in dependence on noisy data and data determined by low dimensional projections.
